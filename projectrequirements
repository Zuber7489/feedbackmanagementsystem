# ✅ **Feedback Management System (FMS) — Updated Requirements (LocalStorage / SessionStorage Only)**

## **1. Project Summary (Updated)**

Goal: Build a Feedback Management System (FMS) to manage training courses, programs, faculties, enrolments, and participant feedback.

**Technology Stack (Updated):**

* **Frontend-only:** Angular 20
* **Storage:** LocalStorage + SessionStorage
* **Authentication:** Client-side session management
* **No backend, no database, no APIs** — all logic implemented inside Angular services.

---

# **2. Actors & Roles**

### **1. Training Admin (ADMIN)**

* Full management of courses, faculties, programs.
* View all reports.

### **2. Training Coordinator (COORDINATOR)**

* Create/modify programs, enrol participants, manage attendance.
* View reports for their own programs.

### **3. Participant (PARTICIPANT)**

* View programs they are enrolled in.
* Submit feedback.

### **4. System (Client-side Services)**

* Simulates automated tasks: report generation, validation.

---

# **3. Functional Requirements (Revised for LocalStorage)**

## **3.1 Authentication (LocalStorage/SessionStorage)**

* User data stored in **LocalStorage** (`users` table).
* Login session stored in **SessionStorage** (`currentUser`).
* Role-based access checks via Angular Guards.

### Supported Flows:

* Login (validate against LocalStorage).
* Logout (clear session).
* Registration (Admin only).

---

## **3.2 Course Management (LocalStorage)**

Stored in: `courses` array in LocalStorage.

Admin can:

* Create Course
* Edit Course
* Delete Course
* View Course List & Details

---

## **3.3 Faculty Management**

Stored in: `faculties` array in LocalStorage.

Admin can:

* Add/update/delete faculty.
* Add/remove skills.
* Search faculty by skill.

---

## **3.4 Training Program Management**

Stored in: `programs` array in LocalStorage.

Fields:

* courseId
* coordinatorId
* facultyIds[]
* dates
* location
* capacity
* status
* participantIds[]

Coordinator/Admin can:

* Create/modify/delete (soft delete)
* Enrol participants
* Mark attendance
* Assign faculties

---

## **3.5 Enrollment Management**

Represented inside program object:

```
program.enrollments = [
  { participantId, attendanceStatus }
]
```

Attendance statuses:

* REGISTERED
* ATTENDED
* NO_SHOW

---

## **3.6 Feedback Module**

Stored in: `feedbacks` array in LocalStorage.

Rules:

* Participant must be enrolled.
* Only one feedback per participant per program.
* Ratings: 1–5.
* Comments optional.

---

## **3.7 Reports (Client-side Computation)**

Generated dynamically using LocalStorage data.

### Report Types:

1. **Program Summary**
2. **Defaulters**
3. **Faculty Performance**
4. **CSV Export** (Client-generated via Blob API)

---

# **4. Data Model (LocalStorage Schema)**

### **LocalStorage Keys Used:**

```
users
courses
faculties
programs
feedbacks
skills (optional)
```

---

## **4.1 User**

```
{
  id,
  name,
  email,
  passwordHash,
  role, // ADMIN, COORDINATOR, PARTICIPANT
  createdAt
}
```

---

## **4.2 Course**

```
{
  id,
  code,
  title,
  description,
  durationDays,
  createdAt
}
```

---

## **4.3 Faculty**

```
{
  id,
  name,
  email,
  skills: []
}
```

---

## **4.4 Training Program**

```
{
  id,
  courseId,
  coordinatorId,
  facultyIds: [],
  startDate,
  endDate,
  location,
  capacity,
  status, // SCHEDULED, COMPLETED, CANCELLED
  enrollments: [
      { participantId, attendanceStatus }
  ],
  createdAt
}
```

---

## **4.5 Feedback**

```
{
  id,
  programId,
  participantId,
  ratings: { q1, q2, q3, overall },
  comments,
  submittedAt
}
```

---

# **5. Angular Component Structure (Frontend Only)**

## **Authentication**

* login.component
* register.component
* auth.guard.ts
* role.guard.ts

## **Admin Pages**

* Manage Courses
* Manage Faculties
* Manage Users
* View Reports

## **Coordinator Pages**

* Program List
* Create/Edit Program
* Enroll Participants
* Mark Attendance
* Reports

## **Participant Pages**

* My Programs
* Submit Feedback
* View Submitted Feedback

---

# **6. Business Rules (Front-End Validation)**

* Cannot exceed program capacity.
* Cannot create program with invalid date ranges.
* Unique feedback per participant per program.
* Only Admin/Coordinator may edit programs.
* Only Admin manages courses/faculties.
* Ratings must be 1–5.
* Programs soft-deleted using `status: CANCELLED`.

---

# **7. Reports (Client-Side Logic)**

## **Program Feedback Summary**

* Total feedback count
* Averages per question
* Overall average
* Rating distribution
* Comments list

## **Feedback Defaulters**

Steps:

1. Get participants with attendance = ATTENDED
2. Get participants who submitted feedback
3. Difference = defaulters

## **Faculty Performance**

* Average rating across programs they taught.

---

# **8. CSV Export (Browser-Only)**

Frontend uses:

```
new Blob([...], { type: 'text/csv' })
```

Downloaded via:

```
FileSaver.saveAs()
```

---

# **9. Development Plan**

### Phase 1 — Core Setup

* Angular app setup
* Services for LocalStorage management
* User auth + roles

### Phase 2 — Management Features

* Courses + Faculties CRUD
* Program CRUD
* Enrolments & Attendance

### Phase 3 — Feedback & Reports

* Feedback forms
* Summary reports
* CSV export

### Phase 4 — UI Polish

* Role-based menu
* Pagination (client-side)
* Toast notifications

---

# **10. Future Enhancements**

* Sync to cloud DB (optional future)
* Email notification (not possible in pure frontend)
* Feedback form designer
* Faculty portal view

---

# ✅ Your requirements have been fully transformed to a **frontend-only FMS using LocalStorage/SessionStorage**.

If you want, I can also provide:

✔ Full Angular folder structure
✔ Service code templates for LocalStorage CRUD
✔ Mock data generator
✔ Sample UI wireframes
✔ Complete JSON schema

Just tell me!
